    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Hi, My name is Mihhail Nikolajenko. I'm from Narva, Estonia ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ª  Also lived a couple years in UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§  and Finland ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®. I have been working in the production of concrete wall panels in Finland for the last few years. Before that I lived in England for several years, worked in a food potato factory, I produced ready-to-eat dishes from potatoes. I am an Automotive Technician by education. That is why I worked in various factories with machines that produce something. </p>
        <p>In general, I have worked in many places, in various fields of activity, I will describe in more detail below. Now I am studying Web Development. I was interested in it back in childhood, when I was in school, I made websites for clans, which I was a member of, while I played one or another computer game... After many years, I decided to return to this and take it more seriously.</p>
